# Mercedes-Benz Test Bench Kaggle

  Daimler is challenging Kagglers to tackle the curse of dimensionality and reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Provided with a dataset representing different permutations of the Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimlerâ€™s standards.
  
  This here is the innitial analysis to help with understanding the dataset better before the training and predictions. 
  
  More updates coming.....
